//! SolverTask Preparation Module (solver-tee3 Architecture)
//!
//! This module handles the preparation of SolverTask for Solver execution.
//! According to solver-tee3 design:
//!
//! - **Validator prepares everything**: coin selection, read_set, Merkle proofs
//! - **Solver is pass-through**: receives SolverTask, passes to TEE
//! - **TEE validates and executes**: verifies proofs, executes STF
//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! - [`TaskPreparer`]: Single-transfer task preparation
//! - [`BatchTaskPreparer`]: Optimized batch preparation (recommended for high throughput)
//!
//! ## BatchTaskPreparer Optimization
//!
//! | Metric | Before (per-tx) | After (batch) | Improvement |
//! |--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
//! | Lock acquisitions | 5-6N | 2 | ~99.6% |
//! | state_root calc | N | 1 | ~99.9% |
//!
//! ## Flow

//! ## StateProvider
//!
//! The `StateProvider` trait and `MerkleStateProvider` implementation are
//! defined in `setu_storage::state_provider`. Use `TaskPreparer::new_for_testing()`
//! for tests, which creates a real MerkleStateProvider with pre-initialized accounts.
