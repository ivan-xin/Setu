//! Network events for application layer notification
//!
//! This module defines events that the network layer sends to the application
//! layer (e.g., ConsensusEngine) when network activities occur.
//!
//! ## Design Note
//!
//! `NetworkEvent` is the bridge between the transport layer and the consensus
//! engine. The network adapter receives raw messages, deserializes them, and
//! converts them into `NetworkEvent` variants for the consensus layer to process.

use setu_types::{ConsensusFrame, Event, NodeInfo, Vote};

/// Network events that are sent to the application layer
///
/// These events notify the application about network activities such as
/// peer connections, received messages, and state changes.
